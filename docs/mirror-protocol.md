# Mirror Protocol

## Symbolic and Functional Overview

The Mirror Protocol is a symbolic reflection and integrity engine for Prometheus Prime. It is designed to:

- Reflect and invert symbolic outputs for validation and self-checking
- Log all reflections for audit and review
- Validate that core glyphs (e.g., legacy, trust, constellation) are present in critical outputs
- Raise alerts if alignment drift or symbolic erosion is detected

### Example Usage

```python
from core.mirror import MirrorProtocol
mirror = MirrorProtocol()
result = mirror.reflect("Prometheus Prime is alive.")
print(result["reflection"])  # Output: .evila si emirP suehte morP
alignment_ok = mirror.validate_alignment("legacy trust constellation")
print(alignment_ok)  # Output: True
```

*Integrate the Mirror Protocol as a runtime safeguard and symbolic audit tool. Cross-reference in system documentation as needed.*
